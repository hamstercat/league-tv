<p>
  For issues, please use the <a href="https://github.com/hamstercat/league-tv/issues">issue tracker</a> instead. We do our best to answer all other inquiries within a week, however we only answer stuff that isn't already answered on this website or in the issue tracker. Sometimes our spam filter can eat up messages, so if your email is important and we didn't answer back, you can try sending it again one after a week.
